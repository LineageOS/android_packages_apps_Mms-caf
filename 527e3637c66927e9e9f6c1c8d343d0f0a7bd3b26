      "message": "So this won\u0027t break the existing overlay functionality (I\u0027m not familiar) because we only handle the touch event and return true if the user is zooming? \n\nSeems good to me, just making sure I\u0027m reading this correctly. Zoom takes precedence and all other events are passed down as usual?",

      "message": "Nah it won\u0027t break it.  And actually in CAF they weren\u0027t using the overlay.  So I just ported the overlay.  We want to \"hijack\" or \"return true\" here to tell the system we are handling the touch event.  Otherwise we just dispatch it to super.  It should only hit that return true when the required conditions are met.  Also we don\u0027t want to delagate the touch event while zooming otherwise it might pop up the message summary dialog thing.",
